#YPI HTML and Express

the Questionnaire folder contains the HTML page where the user would answer the questions. The format of the page
follows the rootPage's format, which is the login page.

The rootPage is the HTML page, taking the username and password.

the ypi folder is the express server for the root page. I did not connect it to the root page as I was not sure how
it would change the process of reactifying everything. (To connect it to the rootPage go to app.js in ypi)
