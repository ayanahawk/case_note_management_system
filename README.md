# YPI Data models

In the models folder we have the three different models for the project. The user and answers model contain the password salting code, but it's not tested yet, so there is a slight chance that the code needs a modification. For now we are trying to test to see if the data in the models are being saved. Still struggle with that code for now. The connection.js file just contains the code that connects mongodb to mongoose and returns a text to show if it's connected or not. The saving_test.js file is the file for saving sample data to the data base, but it's not working in the command line when using the command npm run testing, it's giving the error <embedded>:104995 Unable to locate git workspace root for. For now we are working on this issue.
